Hello Boss.
Thought of different ideas to convey "Happy and Safe Journey"
But asusual.... no plans came or ideas striked my empty mind.

We were working in Docker for a period of time.
So suddenly thought of something innovative through which we can
convey our wishes as well as the knowledge gained because of your help and
support
			"HAPPY AND SAFE JOURNEY"
Come back with good and happy memories and share with us
and we are wishing you happy holidays during the weekends in Amsterdam

"ENJOY ENJOY ENJOY"
